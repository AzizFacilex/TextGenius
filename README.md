# Printed Text Recognition

This program is designed to recognize printed text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. It takes an image of text as input and outputs the corresponding text in a machine-readable format.

## Installation

    Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/AzizFacilex/TextGenius.git
    Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

    Place the image of the text you want to recognize in the images directory.
    Run the program: python textgenius.py
    The recognized text will be printed to the console.

## Additional Output

## Supported Languages

The program currently supports text recognition in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, and Russian.

## Limitations

The accuracy of the program may vary depending on the quality of the input image and the complexity of the text. Additionally, the program may not be able to recognize certain fonts or handwriting styles.

## Future Improvements

In the future, we plan to improve the accuracy and speed of the program by implementing more advanced OCR algorithms and techniques. We also hope to add support for more languages and handwriting styles.
